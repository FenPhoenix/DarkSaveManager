## Dark Save Manager

### Welp, NewDark 1.28 just came out and it has 1500 save slots plus the quick save slot. So this app is now obsolete. No complaints here, in-game is much better!

## Old readme:

### Supports Thief 1/Thief Gold and Thief 2. Doesn't support System Shock 2 at the moment.

Dark Engine games have only 16 save slots (and one of them is for quick saves). Speedrunners may find this limitation frustrating: they may have one save at the start of every mission, leaving no room in the list for mid-mission saves, strat or route testing saves, etc. This utility allows save files to be swapped in and out of the game slots, with an unlimited number able to be stored for later use. Saves can also be renamed. The saves can be swapped in and out while the game is running, requiring only a reload of the saves menu. The in-app saves list updates as you make saves in-game.

### Some todos:
- Support multiple game save and stored save folders
- Support FMs (this would happen automatically with the above)
- Allow reordering saves in the same list
- Improve UI/UX
