## Dark Save Manager

### This is a work in progress; it's not ready for public release. Compile and test at your own risk.

Dark Engine games have only 16 save slots (and one of them is for quick saves). Speedrunners may find this limitation frustrating: they may have one save at the start of every mission, leaving no room in the list for mid-mission saves, strat or route testing saves, etc. This utility allows save files to be swapped in and out of the game slots, with an unlimited number able to be stored for later use. Saves can also be renamed. The saves can be swapped in and out while the game is running, requiring only a reload of the saves menu. The in-app saves list updates as you make saves in-game.

### Some todos:
- Support multiple game save and stored save folders
- Support FMs (this would happen automatically with the above)
- Allow reordering saves in the same list
- Dark mode for preventing eye searing on alt-tab
- Improve UI/UX
